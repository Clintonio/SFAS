SFAS Round 2 Entry

Author: Clinton Alexander

----- Introduction -----

This is my Search For a Star competition round 2 entry. The task was to improve 
an existing, very basic, and broken, game by adding new features and content.
I extended the original 2D block-shooter to a 2D space shooter concept, added
sound, 360 Gamepad support, texturing, very basic animations on the explosions,
enemy types, levels, data driven level and entity loading, a custom JSON parser,
and other features. 

The game is written in C++ and uses the DirectX and DirectSound APIs, and no others
due to a restriction within the competition itself. Visual Studio 2012 files
are included in the source build. 

This game took exactly one week of time to create, with some minor, additional, 
time to refine and remove some bugs that were present in the submitted version. 

----- Usage -----

Run SFAS2012.exe to play the game. 

----- Compilation -----

Currently only compilation within the Visual Studio 2012 IDE has been tested, and
in the source build the relevant VS files have been included.
